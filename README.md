# Fit Tracker

## TODOS

- Calculator components are not technically dumb presententional components, because they do contain some logic, so I should move them to another file
- Add explanations for ActivityLevels
- Start using object as an argument instead of positional arguments for `calculate*` functions
- refactor checking if user is male logic into a `useMale` hook
- highlight current active link in the Navbar
- there are rounded corner on the input box's right side, I might be using the components a little bit incorrect
